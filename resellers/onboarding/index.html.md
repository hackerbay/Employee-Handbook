## New Reseller Onboarding Checklist

To onboard a new reseller, copy the list from below and paste it into a new issue in the [resellers project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/resellers/issues/).

This list looks strange in this handbook but this is to ensure you can copy paste it into an issue. When you paste it in an issue it will have checkboxes that you can click to complete.

The topics are ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled, and the main person responsible is called out at the end of each task. Please update this list as more steps arise.

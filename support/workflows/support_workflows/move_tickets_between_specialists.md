##### Overview

Occasionally some support tickets will land in the wrong specialist queue. For e.g., a GitLab.com
ticket that ends up with EE specialists. Use this workflow to reassign the ticket to the correct
specialist queue.


______________

##### Workflow

1. Open the ticket in ZenDesk.
1. In the "Form" drop-down on the left-hand side, select the correct item, for e.g.,
GitLab.com/GitLab Hosted and then submit.

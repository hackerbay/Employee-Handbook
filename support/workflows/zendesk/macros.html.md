We use Zendesk Macros as a tool to help support common workflows and allow us to support our customers faster. It's important to find a balance of when and where to use a Macro as too many macro responses and the support process becomes robotic and canned. Nobody likes cans.

## Who can create a Macro?

Macros can be created by ZenDesk Admins and should be used for things that require a rigid process (2FA re-auth/DMCA) or when we _need_ to provide a template response (Holiday Coverage).

## Where Macros Live

Macros are namespaced with a `::` which nests them in the bottom of Zendesk Dropdown. The current top level headings are below:

* Escalations - you can use these to move tickets between queues.
* Twitter - Used by the Community Advocacy team.
* General - General Cannery
* Account - For resetting 2FA
* Security - Related to security questions
* DMCA - Responses for the DMCA process

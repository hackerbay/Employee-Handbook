# Local Development Environment

- Use an Ubuntu machine. That's the best flavor of linux out there. We embrace open source and run open source in production, so its best to have your dev environment identical to production. If you're using Windows - switch to Ubuntu. MacOS is occasionally okay since its POSIX. We DON'T recommend using one because its overpriced and gives you exactly the same functionality an Ubuntu machine would give you with third the cost. 
- We use Visual Studio Code as our primary IDE. If you're using anything else, we HIGHLY recommend you to switch to Visual Studio Code. 
- IMPORTANT: Learning about debugging in VS Code is important. It'll save you days of your life (trust us!). [Please check this short 8 min video out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oFKNL7vYV8)
- IMPORTANT: [Please check this short video on Debugging in Chrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0XScE08hy8). It's worth watching. 
- Use Robo Mongo for Local MongoDB Data Viewing and Editing. Download it from here [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download). Important: Do not download Studio 3T but Robo 3T. If you're using Compass on your local machine. Switch to Robo Mongo as it's a much better tool.
- Use Chrome as primary browser. It makes devs lives simpler.

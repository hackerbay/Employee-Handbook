## Other Countries.

- Our primary method of payment is [Transferwise](https://www.transferwise.com).
- If Transferwise is not available in your country. We will use [PayPal](https://paypal.com) to pay you.
- We will do an [International Wire Transfer](https://www.bankofamerica.com/foreign-exchange/wire-transfer.go) or [Western Union](https://westernunion.com/) if both Transferwise and Paypal are not available in your country. This is however the most expensive way to pay for both you and the company and is not recommended.

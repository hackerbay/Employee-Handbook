## General Guidelines

1. Do what is right for our **customers**. Do NOT F--K the Customer. You have food on your table because of him.
1. Build **simple** software. Simple is a keyword here. What we build should be simple enough so it can be used by anyone. If it's not simle enough. Rethink. 

## Intellectual Property and Code

1. Take proper care of any **confidential** information you get from our customers and clients.
1. If you copy code always **check** the license and attribute when needed or appropriate.
1. Check community **contributions** and do not merge it when there can be doubt about the ownership.

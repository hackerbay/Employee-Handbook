# Values

We look for these from our employees. 

- Customer is KING: Do what is right for our customers. Do NOT F--K the Customer. You have food on your table because of him.
- [Strong Work Ethic](/general/work-ethic/README.md): Work is literally worship. It literally puts food on the table for your family, and pays the bills. When you commit to somehting, do it! Few things like, not showing up on standup without letting your manager know, or not reporting to a client at a scheduled time without letting him know in advance will not be tolerated.
- For Engineers: We build simple software. Simple is a keyword here. What we build should be simple enough so it can be used by anyone. If it's not simle enough. Rethink.
- Integrity. 
- Honesty. 
- Empathy


If we think ANY of these values are non-existent. We'll not be working with you.

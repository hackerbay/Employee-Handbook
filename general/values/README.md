# Values

We look for these from our employees. 

- Customer is KING: Do what is right for our customers. Do NOT F--K the Customer. You have food on your table because of him.
- [Strong Work Ethic](/general/work-ethic/README.md) 
- For Engineers: We build simple software. Simple is a keyword here. What we build should be simple enough so it can be used by anyone. If it's not simle enough. Rethink.
- Integrity. 
- Honesty. 
- Empathy


If we think ANY of these values are non-existent. We'll not be working with you.

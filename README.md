# HackerBay Employee Handbook


The HackerBay Employee Handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. As part of our value of being transparent the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback. Please make a pull request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Few sections of this handbook may not open to the world and is only accessible to employees.


### TL;DR: 
If pages are long to read. They will have "Too long; didn't read" which will have the summary of the page. 
This will make it easier and faster for you to read the handbook. 
You're always welcome to dive into more details on any specific page if you like.

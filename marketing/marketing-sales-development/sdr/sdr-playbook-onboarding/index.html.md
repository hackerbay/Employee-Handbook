The playbook is the ultimate success tool for an SDR.


Through this training course you will learn:
* What the standards are for an SDR 
* Buyer Personas 
* SDR Framework
* SDR Touch Pattern
* SDR Qualification
* SDR Handoff


It is important that you learn the playbook and how to use it in your job. This is a 3 week training course where you will learn the concepts mentioned above.


Your manager will create an issue for each of the topics above to track the SDR’s progress by copying the content from the [raw markdown source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/raw/master/source/handbook/sales/sdr/sdr-playbook-onboarding/index.html.md).

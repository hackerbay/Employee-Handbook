# Travel

## Consulting
- Few of our clients might fly you to their office for work. This happens at a client discretion.
- If you're invited, you definitely should accept. This usually never happens, and you're lucky if you're given an offer.
They're sponsored.

## Misc
- There are few other opportunities for Travel. Some of them include getting into Accelerator Programs, Conferences, etc.
- We do fly people to places if we're selected in them.
- Sr Employees are given a primary priority.
- Employees who have been with the company longer are given a secondary priority.  
- We Round Robin employees for travel. We believe everyone should get an opportunity. For example : If we have two employees and if one of them has already traveled recently. Opportunity will be given to the second employee. This rule works for most cases but there can be an exception to suit a business case.
- These are sponsored.

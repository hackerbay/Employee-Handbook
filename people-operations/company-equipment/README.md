- We want to make sure you're productive all the time, and we want to equip you with best machines possible.
- If you need a machine. We'll buy one for you. This will be an Ubuntu machine with a decent Processor, RAM and SSD. Most of the work we do happens on Ubuntu & We support Open Source Software. We DON'T provide Windows and Mac machines at this point. - However we'll get you a Linux box and you can install Windows on it, if you want. We have few Windows licenses available. Talk to @nawazdhandala to get one.
- This will be a Company laptop and In the event of you leaving the company this should be returned to Company HQ in Hyderabad, India or to any other Employee who might need one.

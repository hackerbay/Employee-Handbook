# Employee Onboarding

This document is for all new employees.

- Please fill this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfClAxu4MqpUxOWsHA8jSKvBVRVSJJMBR1HLb2rAh-B6QELJg/viewform) and give us your interview feedback. 


- If you haven't signed your offer letter already. Its a good idea to do it right now before proceeding further. If your offer letter is not counter-signed by someone in the HackerBay team. Let the person who interviewed you know immediately.

- If you don't know who you report to, Ask someone you interviewed you immediately.

- When you're on Slack:
  - Please make sure your username is <firstname><lastname> and you have a good profile picture uploaded to Slack. This will ensure team members can recognize you and contact you easily.
  - We use Slack as our primary mode of communication. It's a good idea to have the Slack app downloaded and installed both on your Desktop and on your phone.
  - Please also update your Slack Profile with Email, Phone Number, and Skype Username. It'll be easier for other team members to reach out.
  - Our company Slack URL is hackerbaycompany.slack.com

- Send your Passport (if you don't have your passport, send in your valid Govt ID instead. Also, apply for a passport immediately.), Your Address, Your Bank Account Details (Ac No, IFSC, Account Name, Bank Name, Branch Name, and Bank Address), Your National ID, Your valid Tax ID, Your primary and secondary contact number - to legal@hackerbay.io

- If you're NOT a US Citizen, a Permanent Resident, and are not in the US. Please fill the form [W8-BEN](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf). This form basically states that you're not connected to the US in any way and we will not withhold your taxes. [Here's a sample form.](https://www.unfcu.org/W8BEN-sample/)

- Sign up on Trello (if you don't have an account already) and send your username to your manager.

- Sign up to [Hubstaff](https://hubstaff.com). Select a FREE plan, create a new organisation / project called 'hackerbay'. Send your username and password (yes, we need your password here). Send the credentials to legal@hackerbay.io. Since this is a remote job, like any other remote company we use Hubstaff to track time.
